            <h4>Recipe Instructions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat (we use a Dutch oven). Add the shaped meatballs and cook until browned, about 8 minutes. As the meat cooks, use a wooden spoon to break it up. </li>
                <li>Add the onions and cook, stirring every once and a while, until softened and browned, about 4-5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir in the garlic, tomato paste, oregano, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring continuously for about 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Pour in the water and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any bits of meat or onion stuck to the bottom of the pot.</li>
                <li>Stir in the tomatoes, 3/4 teaspoon of salt, and a generous pinch of black pepper. Bring the sauce to a low simmer. Cook, uncovered, at a low simmer for 25 minutes.</li>
                <li>About 15 minutes before the sauce finishes cooking, bring a large pot of salted water to the boil, and then cook pasta according to package directions. Check every few minutes for doneness</li>
                <li>Take the sauce off of the heat, and then stir in the basil.</li>
                <li>Toss in the cooked pasta, and then leave for a minute so that the pasta absorbs some of the sauce. Toss again, and then serve with parmesan sprinkled on top.</li>
                <li>Enjoy your freshly cooked spaghetti dish!</li>
